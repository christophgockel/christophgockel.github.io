title: Getting back to Java
---

Today all of the London apprentices (and two from Chicago) got an introduction into Java by [Mike Jansen](http://www.8thlight.com/team/mike-jansen).

Since I used Java for some time already it wasn't all new to me &ndash; even though it's been some years since then.

The application we're working on is a small example project by 8th Light called &ldquo;[Ledjer](https://github.com/8thlight/ledjer)&rdquo;. In it a `Ledger` class is used to store payments, deposits and some more things. Since it's used as an example the intention is not to have a 100% accurate representation of a ledger (accounting wise), but to get used to Java on the one hand, and on the other to familiarise ourselves with [FitNesse](http://fitnesse.org/) as an acceptance testing tool.

Overall it's fun, and Java skills wise not too challenging yet. But FitNesse does some interesting (read: weird) things to automatically connect the FIT tables with Java code/fixtures. Often I find myself to write class and method names by try and error until FitNesse is pleased to use the fixture. But once you've seen and realised how everything connects together I begins to make sense.

Tomorrow we have our second meeting with Mike and the other apprentices to proceed with the exercises.
