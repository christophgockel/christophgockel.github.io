Finally my first contact with Rails!

Since our kickoff meeting on Friday, today Makis and I started working on our first story for this iteration. We spiked most of it just to get an idea how the codebase is organized and see some results earlier.

Makis has Rails experience, I do not. Which sometimes is really frustrating since there seems to be a lot going on behind the scenes what I just don't know yet. I definitely need to get more into Ruby and go through the [guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) and other ressources.
