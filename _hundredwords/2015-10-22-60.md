They're out on their horses to scout the area, for possible escape routes for their escape of the town.
There's a ravine with half-finished bridge.
Which could work for them they imagine &ndash; not easy, but doable.
While they think about how they could make it work they hear something.
Then they see a horse-drawn carriage with a panicked horse heading directly towards the ravine, with a lady sitting atop the carriage screaming for help.
They immediately set spurs on their horses to help her.
Not to imagine if the horse runs over the edge.
An incident like that could give the ravine a whole new name.
The story behind it would likely be forgotten in around 100 years time, though.
