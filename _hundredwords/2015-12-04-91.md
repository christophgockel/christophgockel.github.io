Detective Somerset sent his new colleague Detective Mills away from the crime scene they were investigating.
He should help the other officers question the neighbours.
Mills is not happy with that.
He's a detective and he wants to be treated like that.
When they're back in the car driving back, Mills starts a discussion about what happened.
Somerset says he needed to make a decision and he needed to make it quick.
It was all to keep the integrity of the crime scene and nothing personal.
He tells him he should not worry about it.
He will treat him professionally, and the only thing he asks for is that he shouldn't dramatise these sort of things.
