Clark was cranky for the past few days.
The christmas holidays are exhausting for everyone, but Clark also waited for his bonus letter to get delivered.
Then, when the letter finally arrived at his home, he was eager to open it.
Before he does it, though, he apologizes to his family for having been a little short with everyone.
Then the time has come.
He opens the letter and reads it.
And can't believe what he just read.
Everyone gets a bit worried that Clark stays so calm and quiet.
He then announces that it's not a bonus, but a one-year membership
in the Jelly-of-the-Month club.
