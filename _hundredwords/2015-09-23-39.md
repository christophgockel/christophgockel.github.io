Two best friends from Britain, Graeme and Clive, are on their way to Comic Con, San Diego.
While walking to the conference they already feel like they're in the middle of at least three different movies.
There are orcs, soldiers and superheroes waiting together with them for green light at pelican crossings.
Once at the conference they're in total awe of the whole conference experience.
Queueing almost everywhere they try out a lot of video games, attend panels, buying merchandise.
All in all they're having a really good time.
Then they finally queue up for their favourite comic book author.
Just to realise that, once they talk to him, he's a complete and utter dickhead.
