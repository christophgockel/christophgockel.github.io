Daniel drives his delivery scooter confidently through the streets of Marseilles.
He's quickly dodging other cars left and right, overtaking every other vehicle he comes across.
Curves are being taken so sharp the scooter sprays sparks constantly.
He knows this round has to be good as it is the last one for him on this scooter.
So he confidently leans in even more almost as if denying gravity.
He knows that when he resigns from his job today he's got to do it with a bang!
Arriving at the goal his friend stops the watch and Daniel immediately asks how he'd done.
_4:32._
He set another record before he leaves.
