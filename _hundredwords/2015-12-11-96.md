Anakin is tasked to protect Senator Palpatine.
For a few days he hasn't move from his side.
So they sit together in an opera house on Coruscant.
Palpatine starts talking about the Jedi Order, the republic and democracy.
He knows exactly which buttons to push.
Anakin is very open to suggestions as his view of the world got shaken.
But he is adamant about his love to Padme, and he would do anything to protect her.
Palpatine uses that for his benefit and starts telling him about the tragedy of Darth Plagueis.
A very old Sith legend.
Once Palpatine mentions that Darth Palgueis was able to save people from death, Anakin is all ears.
