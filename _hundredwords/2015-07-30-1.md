I'm walking home with my groceries.
I switch on the lights of my bungalow as soon as I enter it.
Something feels different.
My head is tucked into a guy's armpit all of a sudden.
I have no idea who that bloke is, but he is pushing me into my bungalow's bathroom.
He's plunging my head into the toilet.
I'm blowing bubbles.
Some guy says they want money.
My head gets pulled out of the toilet and I'm gasping for air.
I can offer only one thing: to take a closer look down the toilet &ndash; maybe the money is there.
