After the big explosion John tries to contact Al again with his walkie-talkie.
Al is worried and asks if he's alright, and John assures he's fine.
It was just some explosives he ignited to take away the leverage the hostage-takers have.
While Al is talking to John, his boss, the Deputy Chief of Police, walks by hearing him talking to John.
He takes the walkie-talkie and makes his point very clear that he doesn't want help from a random stranger &ndash; even if he's in the building.
John doesn't want to be patronised by anybody in this situation and tells him to jog on and give the walkie-talkie back to Al.
