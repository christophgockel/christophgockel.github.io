Pam asks Warren, the guy behind the bar, if he could vouch for anyone to give her a ride home.
The moment Stuntman Mike hears that, he offers her a ride.
They start bantering and after a while Pam buys him a virgin pi&ntilde;a colada and a cadillac cabo wabo margarita for herself.
She wants to know more about him and asks in which movies he worked on so far.
All the movies he lists, she never heard about, though.
Then asking how he got into the stunt business.
That's easy to answer for him, his brother got him in.
Stuntman Bob.
