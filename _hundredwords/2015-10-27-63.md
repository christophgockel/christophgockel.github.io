He just arrived in the city.
Got no clothes, no money, no nothing.
He figured, the homeless person right next to him probably does not need all his clothes right now.
So he picks up a pair of trousers and puts it on.
In that moment a police car stops by observing his doing.
For them it must look rather suspicious, even though he didn't do any harm.
When he starts to run away they go after him into the alley.
After one officer catches up with him they get into a fight.
But he eventually gets hold of the officer's gun.
Pointing it at the officer he abrasively asks which day it is.
