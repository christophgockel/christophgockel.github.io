Mitch, Frank and Bernard are on a hunt chasing new candidates for their fraternity targeting the next person who went shopping with his wife in a supermarket and as they drive around the parking lot looking for him, they crash into the couple's shopping trolley while coming to a screeching halt and jumping out of the van to abduct him.
Frank goes on and threatens his wife, who is standing there speechless, if she tells anyone about that he'd come back and kill her, but immediately putting on a smiling face again, apologising to her saying the he'll be fine and they will bring him back later that night.
