There he is.
Kneeling on all fours in this open field.
Crying.
Helpless.
Seemingly unable to comprehend the world.
This whole &ldquo;family trip&rdquo; had been a complete disaster already.
But things got worse for him by several orders of magnitude, just one minute ago.
He understood the words his uncle was saying, but was unable to comprehend them completely.
Until he did.
He is colour blind.
He will never become a test pilot at the Air Force Academy.
Once grasped, he went berserk.
Punching and kicking the car seats and interior.
Until his dad pulled the van over so he could get out and vent his frustration by loudly screaming &ldquo;_F********CK_&rdquo;!
