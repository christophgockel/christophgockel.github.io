Avi calls Doug to ask where and how he could reach Franky Four Fingers, and Doug answers that he will see him later because Franky asked for money, but first he'd go out and watch a fight which makes Avi furious and he explains to Doug that Franky can't be trusted when it comes to money as he is always gambling and that he didn't get the nickname _Four Fingers_ without reason&hellip;
Unsettling as all that sounds Avi decides to fly to London immediately, so the next thing he does is boarding a plane and the first thing Doug hears from him after he hung up on him on the phone is a warm greeting with _&ldquo;shut up and sit down.&rdquo;_
