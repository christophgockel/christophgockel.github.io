Harvey is late for the hearing.
Everyone is waiting already, and Rachel &ndash; his attorney partner &ndash; tells him exactly that once he sits down next to her.
He's the district attorney after all, but now that everyone is present, the judge is announced.
Next Harvey can interrogate his primary witness.
Unfortunately the witness derails from his initial sworn statement, that the accused, Salvatore Maroni, would be the new head of the Falcone crime family.
When Harvey asks the judge to call his witness hostile, the witness actually pulls out a carbon fibre gun and points it towards Harvey.
Who reacts quickly and disarm the witness before anyone could get hurt.
