It's driving me insane.
Why?
Why did she insist doing it that way?
Waiting for the universe to do its magic&hellip;
First my phone number on a $5 bill, then her number written in a book.
How am I supposed to find that book ever again?
It feels, I've been to every used books store in New York at least twice.
We met only for a few hours.
Yet it felt completely different to anything I've experienced before.
I can't explain it.
Only one thing I know for sure:
I will never forget her saying &ldquo;_My name is Sara_&rdquo; right before the elevator doors closed.
