Adam and Barbara arrive at some kind of waiting room, unsure what to do after looking around and seeing a lot of strange people sitting there.
There is a chubby man, who seem to have swallowed a whole chicken bone; a woman who seemed to be an assistant to a magician &ndash; an obviously bad one &ndash; who is literally cut in half, a hunter who looks like a victim of some sort spell seeing his shrunken head; a diver with &ldquo;his&rdquo; shark, who got attacked by said shark and a few more people who seem to have died under the weirdest circumstances.
