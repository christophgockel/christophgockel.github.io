Since what he had to see on his last mission, Finn questions his life.
It's not what he thinks is right.
He has to get out of there and leave this ship.
And he will do so by helping Poe, the prisoner they took on their last mission, escape.
Finn, in his full Stormtrooper gear, convinces the other guards that the prisoner needs to be relocated.
After getting out of Poe's cell, Finn takes him aside and gives him a quick heads up.
He needs to leave this ship and wants him as his pilot, in return he will release him to his freedom.
