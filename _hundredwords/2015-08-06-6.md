I'm still shocked&hellip;
Just a few hours earlier my friend Deanna was killed by a shark.
The panic on the beach was horrendous.
I'm glad to be back safe in my bar at the beach.
This hellish storm is all over the news on the TV.
No other storm so far has caused this confusion and panic.
I tell everyone the restaurant is closed.
Screaming at people to leave this place just to make them go somewhere safe.
Next thing I hear is the piercing sound of shattering glass.
Waves are already flowing through the broken window.
With it a shark suddenly being swashed into my bar.
