After starting a fight in the prison and beating up a bunch of prisoners Bruce is put into an isolation cell.
In the corner of the cell is already a man in a suit named Ducard waiting for him.
Asking questions about what he wants to do with his life, if not wasting it away in a prison.
Ducard addresses him by his name, which surprises Bruce at first, and offers him a path out of his misery being locked in a cell.
Tomorrow he would be released and he challenges Bruce to pick a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes and carry it to the top of the mountain.
