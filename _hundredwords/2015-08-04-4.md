They call me Frank Cadillac.
My evening magic show isn't outstanding, but it pays the bills.
Las Vegas drowns you easily.
Budget is tight on Wednesday nights.
The casino next door compensates for that.
Their one-armed bandits disburse well.
&ldquo;The house wins?&rdquo;
That saying means nothing to me.
Attention avoiding is the key.
A new game offers more cover.
Blackjack yields good money.
Many rounds go well.
I feel safe so far.
Things change suddenly.
Men coming towards my table.
I stub out my cigarette and leave.
