The idea of the movie sounded so good at the beginning&hellip;
Unfortunately, an action movie consulted by John &ldquo;Four Leaf&rdquo; Tayback, an actual veteran, starring four mediocre actors, the fading action hero Tugg Speedman, five-time Academy Award-winning Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus, rapper Alpa Chino and drug-addicted comedian Jeff Portnoy and directed by novice director Damien Cockburn swallowed up more budget than the studio had initially anticipated.
It also didn't help that the main cast is a group of prima donna actors, but it's the only way Damien sees to make this movie a success, especially after John Tayback suggested shooting the whole movie guerilla style with hidden cameras in the jungle.
