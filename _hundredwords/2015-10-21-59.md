The two secret agents were tasked to capture the biggest villain, as he imposes an immense threat to the world.
While locating their target, they have been captured by his guards.
They're now in the secret office of Uhand Van Der Smutt.
Uhand introduces himself and welcomes the two &ldquo;guests&rdquo;.
After some chit chat he offers them a quick meal.
He asks if they'd like a smoke and a pancake, or a flapjack and a cigarette, a cigar and a waffle, pipe and a cr&ecirc;pe or even a bong and a blintz.
They denied every offer, and Uhand annoyingly responds that it seems they weren't easy to please.
