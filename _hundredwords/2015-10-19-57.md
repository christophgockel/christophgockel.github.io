They tracked and captured the assassin who tried to push them off the mountain road with his car.
She's holding him in a headlock and he's interrogating him.
Or he's trying to.
Every question he asks, he has to ask three times until the assassin finally reveals an answer.
But before he can answer more questions, he is taken out by a crew member of his to shut him up and not reveal any more information.
A poison dart makes him stagger towards the cliff until he falls over the edge.
Which wasn't deadly for him, though.
He can still talk about his injuries and that he's in an extraordinarily
large amount of pain.
