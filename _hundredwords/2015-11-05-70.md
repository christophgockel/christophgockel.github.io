Gordy is still mourning the loss of his son and wife.
The bomb attack is all over the news and when he hears a so-called expert talking about how the mother and kid who died were regrettable but more of a collateral damage, Gordy snaps.
He finds the news station of the guy interviews and starts tearing the equipment apart.
He knocks over the racks he passes by, and when he finds a baseball bat, he starts smashing whatever is on the desks of the office.
Gordy is furious and goes all out without regrets.
Only until a FBI teams storms in to put him out of action with a taser gun.
