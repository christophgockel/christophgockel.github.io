A helicopter approaches a secret coastal military base and lands safely on the helipad.
Several people alight the helicopter, while one man silently waits until most of them get off the machine.
Placidly he lights a cigar until he is the only one left.
He then drops of his bag and gets out, too.
Heading directly to a convoy of jeeps that will take him and the others to the main briefing room.
When the convoy arrives at its destination, he gets out of his jeep.
A general, he seemingly knows already waits outside a building to greet him.
Swiftly he's heading to the general as if he doesn't want to waste anyone's time &ndash; especially not his own.
