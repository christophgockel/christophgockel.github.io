Cindy's completely out of her mind and confused.
She just had to watch this guy stabbing her boyfriend, and now she's in an interrogation room of the police together with detective Phoebe O'Hara.
John, watching from the other side, can't believe it.
He's after Cullen for years and now he sees his last chance fade.
_Finally_ a witness to a crime Cullen committed.
But the other Phoebe seems to blow the interrogation and it looks like they're not getting any information out of Cindy.
There was a slight chance to turn it.
At least up until Cindy stood up, scolding everyone and demanding to be set free again, since they have nothing to hold against her.
