In a room near the top of a skyscraper two guys have an argument.
One of them not being happy with how everything they've done together turned out now.
The other guy tries to assure that he'd take care of everything &ndash; like he always did.
This reassurance goes unheeded, though.
The whole argument culminates in one guy shooting himself in the head.
Being left alone now, the other guy tries to understand what just happened.
Suddenly his girlfriend appears.
Shocked by the scene she walked into, he greets her with _&ldquo;You met me at a very strange time in my life.&rdquo;_
