Mariner lives happily outside on the wide open sea.
He goes for a diving for food and stays under water for some time.
While his boat is unmanned, a scavenger passes by and looks around.
He waits for some time to see if anyone is on the other boat or emerges from under water.
But nothing happens.
To him it seems like an empty boat out on the sea.
So he boards and picks up some things, including lemons from a small tree Mariner keeps on his boat.
He's already on his boat and on his way when Mariner emerges and boards his boat again.
Not knowing he got robbed.
