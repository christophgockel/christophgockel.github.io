After crash landing his X-Wing on Dagobah, Luke unloads equipment from it to create a shelter.
Since he doesn't know how to get the X-Wing out of the swamp, he's not sure how long he will stay on this lonely planet.
He originally went to this planet to find a Jedi master named &ldquo;Yoda&rdquo;, but he has no idea how to find anyone there now.
He doesn't need to look any further because he's surprised by a small little creature that showed up all of a sudden.
The creature is asking what he's doing on this planet and Luke tells it he's looking for someone.
&ldquo;_Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?_&rdquo;
