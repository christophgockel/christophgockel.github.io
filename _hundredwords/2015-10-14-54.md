Ranger Earl McGraw, stops at Benny's World of Liquor, a convenience store in the middle of nowhere.
He walks into it, grabs a beer and shoots the breeze with Pete behind the counter.
After a while he goes to the bathroom.
That's when Seth and Richard walk to the counter quickly.
Together with their guns targeted at their two hostages.
They're suspicious that Pete gave Earl signals by scratching his arm.
Pete's resolute about that he didn't give any signals, he's scared as hell and doesn't want to blow things up.
When they hear the toilet flushing, Seth and Richard take the hostages and go back between the shelfs.
