The life of Cal and Emily looked perfect from the outside.
Then, Emily asked for a divorce.
Crestfallen, Cal tries to get his life back on track, not really capable of letting go of his old life.
When picking up some of his belongings from their home, Emily struggles to have a conversation with Cal.
She tries to enunciate a genuine apology, but doesn't find the right words.
In a very calm and polite, yet very passive, way Cal just talks about how the flowers in the garden need to be fertilised and how to operate the sprinkler valve.
