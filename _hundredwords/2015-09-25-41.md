A dad, a mother, two kids &ndash; brother and sister &ndash; and a newborn are travelling in their RV.
While waiting in queue at the Mexican border, they get into a chat with another family right next to them.
They are quite nervous and try to hide it with the chatting, but as soon as the other family sees the newborn wrapped in a blanket, things get edgy.
The other family doesn't understand why they don't get to see the baby.
But they don't know that the baby is actually not a baby.
It's a kilo of fresh pot they want to smuggle across the border.
