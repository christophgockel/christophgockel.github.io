He's waking up in the kitchen, leaning on the fridge, with no idea what day or time it is.
He and his friend Ed had a long night out.
Before anything, he needs to get a coke from the corner shop nearby.
He's too hung over.
Ed, his friend, is still sleeping on the couch.
He's stopping at the door to the living room asking Ed if he wants something from the shop.
Ed just replies _&ldquo;Cornetto&rdquo;_ and off he walks to the shop.
He's still not really awake, so he doesn't realise what is happening around him.
