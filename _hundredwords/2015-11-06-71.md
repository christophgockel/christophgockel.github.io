Amber is happily doing her morning workout when she suddenly sees someone standing in her apartment.
But Ben is also surprised that there's a woman in his brother's apartment.
After the initial shock, she tells him that she moved in the month before, after the last tenant was taken away for re-education &ndash; at least that's what the entertainment division of the justice department calls it.
Ben promises her if she doesn't make a sound he'll be gone in five minutes.
He's on the run after all, and Amber knows that.
She just saw the public warning about Ben on a news channel.
