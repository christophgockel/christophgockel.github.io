A second after that, Slinky walks by and Woody can ask him to help with gathering everyone up.
Woody calls in a staff meeting.
He asks Snake and Robot to help building a makeshift podium for it and they start working on it immediately.

Everyone is gathering up now.
There's Etch, Rocky Gibraltar, Mr. Potato Head, Rex, Bo, Slinky, Snake, Robot, Mr. Spell and many others&hellip;
Woody gets a microphone from Mike and starts welcoming everyone.
