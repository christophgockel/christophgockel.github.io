The battle fought and over in the colosseum, we are about to go back to the slave's quarters.
Guards blocking our way.
We're surprised and uncertain what would happen next.
A big gate opens up and the emperor's guards walk in.
The emperor himself follows next.
All of us gladiators kneel before him.
He praises our skill as a group.
I'd earned my fame rightfully.
He calls me &ldquo;spaniard&rdquo;.
That name gained more reach than I expected.
The emperor wants to know my real name.
I do not want to tell him, so I walk away.
He gets angry and demands my answer.
I turn around and tell him &ldquo;_My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius_.&ldquo;
