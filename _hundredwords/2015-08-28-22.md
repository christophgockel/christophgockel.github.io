The battle between the giant robot and the alienish opponent went on already for some time.
It's a long and exhausting fight where it is not clear who of the two contestants will prevail.
Sometimes the huge robot deals a fair amount of damage, but as a reply he often times get thrown into one of the buildings nearby.
They are fighting in the middle of Hong Kong after all.
At one time it seems it's needed to bring the big &ldquo;guns&rdquo;.
And the figurative _gun_ in this case is a cargo ship.
A cargo ship that is used as a baseball bat by the robot now.
