Meredith left the family dinner, she was invited to, after she caused some kerfuffle about a sensitive topic.
She was embarrassed and didn't want to see anyone.
Ben followed and caught up with her at a local pub she went in.
Meredith tries to explain why she said what she said and that she's not a bad person.
Ben tells her she's a total mess &ndash; in the best possible sense, of course.
She's telling him that she's trying very hard to make it right and not upset people with the things she says and does.
Ben's advice to that is that she should just stop.
Stop trying, and relax.
