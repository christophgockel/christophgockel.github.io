The five of them arrive at Builders Emporium, a huge hardware store.
There they should be able to find all parts to build good robot versions of themselves, to stand against the evil versions that have taken over their lives.
They buy a lot of cables, screws, shower hoses, fittings, a dust buster, metal tubes, lamps, faucets, a garbage disposer and a whole lot of other seemingly random parts.
Once they loaded the van with all the parts they need, they hit the road again and start assembling the robots in the back of the van as soon as they leave the parking lot.
