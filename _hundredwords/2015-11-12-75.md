Donkey is running away from the royal guards.
He's running so fast that he doesn't see what, or better who, is standing in his path.
So he bumps into a huge green ogre.
Surprised the ogre turns around to see what hit him.
He looks into the scared, yet surprised, eyes of a donkey sitting on the ground.
Some guards are running up the path towards the two of them.
When Donkey hears them, he quickly tries to hide behind the ogre.
The head guard approaches them and requests, by the order of Lord Farquaard, that they come with them as they are under arrest.
