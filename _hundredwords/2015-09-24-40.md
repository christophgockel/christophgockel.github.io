Walter is waiting for his train to arrive when suddenly he hears people screaming.
Turning around, he sees a building on fire and people running out of it in fear.
He hears one woman in front of the building crying for her disabled dog who seems to be still in the building.
Walter does not hesitate and runs into the flames.
When he found the dog he picked him up and carried him outside.
The woman is very grateful for that and is astonished when Walter hands her prosthetic legs for her dog he quickly assembled on his way down.
Then Walter wakes up from his daydream watching his train leaving the platform.
