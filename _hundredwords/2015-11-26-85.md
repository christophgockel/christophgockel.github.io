Lois reads her latest article to Perry, her editor.
It's about her experience at the polar excavation site.
Where an object had been located deep under thick layers of ice and then suddenly disappeared in the night.
Perry says he can't print it because she might have hallucinated half of the story due to the polar conditions.
She also has interviews with civilians supporting her story, but Perry says the Pentagon denied everything she wrote.
Lois' point is that that's exactly what an institution like the Pentagon is supposed to do.
She asks him to reconsider his decision; she's a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter after all.
Perry's reply to that is she should act like one then!
