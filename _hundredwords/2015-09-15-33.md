He's arriving at his flat, parking the car somewhere nearby, but not too close, because he wants to avoid being seen by his landlord as he's a bit behind on this month's rent.
On his way home he bought some groceries he grabs from the passenger seat as he gets out of his car, then using the big brown bag as some kind of camouflage when he passes his landlord's window.
As his key slides into the door lock he realises he has been seen because he hears the raspy voice of his unfriendly-towards-animals landlord asking _&ldquo;what's all the pet food for?&rdquo;_ which he quickly answers, while exceedingly aware that pets are in fact not allowed in his flat, with _&ldquo;Fiber&rdquo;_.
