Luke and his uncle Owen just bought two new droids and he's tasked to take care of them.
He starts putting C-3PO into an oil bath which delighted the android.
Luke himself sees it more as a chore, fixing old droids and such.
He wants to get out of this place exploring the world.
While cleaning R2-D2 Luke suddenly starts a holographic message that shows a woman asking for help.
And she mentions the name Obi-Wan Kenobi.
A name Luke never heard before, but he does know a Ben Kenobi.
He's a hermit living somewhere out in the desert beyond the dune sea.
