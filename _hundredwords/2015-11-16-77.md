After almost being destroyed by a team of girl scouts, the team knows they need help.
They're back in their gym discussing the situation when suddenly the old legend Patches O'Houlihan comes through the door.
They're in a good mood and someone like Patches will surely help them to improve their game.
Patches starts by introducing them to the _Five Ds of dodgeball:_
dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge.
Justin asks when they would start with the training.
&ldquo;_That's what this sack of wrenches is for,_&rdquo; Patches replies, &ldquo;_if you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball._&rdquo;
