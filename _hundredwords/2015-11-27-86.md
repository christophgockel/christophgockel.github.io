Natasha is tied to a chair surrounded by a man who seems to be a general in the Russian military and two of his henchmen.
He's asking her about her mission and who sent her.
She's giving just enough information to lure him into providing more information to her.
He's not even realising that she was bluffing, but goes on and explains half of his operation to her.
Until his phone rings a someone calls him to tell him to get Natasha on the phone.
Baffled by the threat the person on the other end imposed &ndash; blowing up the building they're in &ndash; he slowly holds the phone next to Natasha's ear.
