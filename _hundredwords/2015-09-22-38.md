Nacho tries to persuade his new friend Steve into lucha libre together with him.
Steve is not into it, and part of the reason for his hesitation might be because Nacho actually wrestled him to the floor to start this conversation.
Eventually he agrees and they start practising for their first match.
Their training could be described as &ldquo;interdisciplinary&rdquo;.
They start by shooting cantaloupes at each other with a giant slingshot to harden their abs.
Next they blindfolded try to dodge arrows to increase agility.
Then the supreme discipline for agility is due: entering a bull's enclosure and trying to dodge him.
Which turned out to not be the best idea, or they're just bad at it.
But anything it takes to become luchadores!
Until the day of their first match finally comes&hellip;
