Gerry meets Holly on a road in the Irish countryside.
She's standing there looking down at a map in her hand, looking up in the direction of the road and then looking down at the map again.
Just when he wanted to ask her, she turns to him, saying that she's looking for Wicklow Mountains National Park but seems to be lost.
Smiling, he's telling her that she _is_ in the park already.
When he continues to ask her where she's heading towards, she mentions she's going back to her B&amp;B in Dunlougahairy.
Gerry then has to smile how the way she pronounces the name of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.
