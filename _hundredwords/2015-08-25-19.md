John has been given a lift to the mentioned address by Chas.
Chas is completely left in the dark about what is going to happen there.
The only thing he gets to know is the address where to drive.
And it's driving him nuts to constantly wait in the car.
He can take care of himself.
He's no kid anymore.
But John doesn't want him to get active in the field.
While waiting for John to do his work, Chas even practices his opening line.
Then suddenly he's been yelled at by John telling him to get his car moved.
Obviously, without telling him why the car should be moved.
