Bill, proudly wearing his umbrella hat, stands at the tee ready for the first stroke of the hole.
Energetically trying to persuade the ball to be his friend; to help him executing a good swing.
Which seemingly helped since the ball lands softly on the green.
After being congratulated hypocritically by his fellow players next to him, he tries to start a serious discussion with Michael about the NBA.
The association needed to face reality he said.
If it doesn't want to lose good talent, it should maybe even think about attracting new players that never even had the slightest thought about a professional career.
He then honestly asks Michael if he'd be able to stand a chance at it.
Which Michael unhesitatingly denied.
