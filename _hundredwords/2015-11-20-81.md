He's on a phone call while standing in a hotel room.
In a very direct, but not arrogant, way, he's making it clear to the person on the other end, that he knows what he's doing.
If he's booked as a driver, he is a driver.
There are hundred thousand streets in the city, which his client doesn't need to know, but he will take care of.
For a window of exactly five minutes he'd be responsible for whoever needs to get from point A to point B.
There's no room for adjustment, the client takes the five minutes or the whole deal is off.
After ending the call, he's going to his car.
