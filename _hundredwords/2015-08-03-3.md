The garage gate opens and we slip through it as soon as a resident drives out of it.
All of us searching for you.
We walk along row after row of parked cars.
You're spotted and everyone stops.
The group takes a moment of silence.
Everyone feels this encounter is heavy with meaning.
I approach you in a reluctant manner.
The memories come back.
We have quite some history.
That history went not very well for either of us.
This encounter is meant to be short-lived, though.

I leave you with the words _&ldquo;See you in a few days, Eleanor.&rdquo;_
