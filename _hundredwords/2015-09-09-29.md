With the mirthmobile they drive to the Alice Cooper concert in Milwaukee.
They have a really good time in the crowd until they decide to go backstage because they also have backstage passes for that area.
Proudly they wave their passes around and show it every person they come across.
Officials who need to see them, others who do not need to see them and even random people who don't care who they are or where they head to.
Until they finally arrive in Alice's room backstage.
They introduce themselves and immediately drop to their knees praying they're not worthy.
