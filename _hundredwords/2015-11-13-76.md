When Flint shows Sam his laboratory she's surprised.
It seems he'd spend much time alone there&hellip;
But then he eagerly shows her his newest and most brilliant invention: the Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator.
Or in short FLDSMDFR.
Where the gist is that you put in water at the top, and food comes out at the bottom.
Since Sam is more interested, Flint goes on and explains how the machine uses a principle of hydro-genetic mutation.
In which water molecules are bombarded with microwave radiation, that mutates their genetic recipe into any kind of food you'd want.
