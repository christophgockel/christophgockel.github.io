Gary tries to drum up his old friends and gives everyone a visit.
Now he waits patiently to get into Andrew's office, while his PA announces Gary's arrival.
Andrew is suspicious and asks what he wants from him.
&ldquo;_Unfinished business_.&rdquo;
All the boys back to Newton Haven for a night out.
To finish the _Golden Mile_.
Twelve pubs along a legendary path of alcoholic indulgence.
Andrew can't believe his ears and asks if that's a joke.
But Gary is serious.
_Five guys. Twelve pubs. Fifty pints._
Erm, _Sixty pints._
Andrew tells him that he hadn't had a drink for sixteen years.
_&ldquo;You must be thirsty then&rdquo;_ Gary replied.
