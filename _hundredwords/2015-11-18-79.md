His father tasked Richie to take his Grandma Florence back to the home.
They're driving in his pickup truck and Richie is trying to start a conversation.
He's asking if she'd ever thought about living long enough to see Martians landing on earth.
It's already 1996 in the end.
She doesn't respond.
He goes on that she must have seen some pretty crazy things in her time.
That he can imagine people were scared when the train was invented.
&ldquo;_Come on!_&rdquo; she responds half angry and half in shock because she can't believe how her nephew thinks she's _that_ old.
