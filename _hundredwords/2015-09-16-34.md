The three friends have an idea of a plan, but no clue on how to approach it, so they try to get help from a stranger, which led them to a bar in a shady area of the city and all three of them enter the bar scared.
They look around not knowing how they should approach it, but agreeing on that it's probably not the best idea to just yell around _&ldquo;anybody here kill for money?&rdquo;_, whereas Kurt completely cocksure of himself just asks his friends to follow along while he approaches the bar asking the bartender without hesitation _&ldquo;does anyone here kill people for money?&rdquo;_
