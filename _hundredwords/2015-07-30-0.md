title: 100 Words 100 Days
---

My friend Daniel started an interesting writing challenge today.
Write 100 words about something everyday for 100 days.
While hesitating first, I wanted to take part in it mostly because I need to get myself out of my comfort zone. Which is too comfortable at the moment.
The good thing is that many of us in the office take part in it.
I don't like to admit it, but that's the sort of peer pressure I need.
This post isn't meant to count for the challenge itself, though.
Just wanted to give an introduction and &ldquo;set the stage&rdquo;.
