What a beautiful day.
I carry a tree trunk that I just cut down towards our home.
The next thing on the list is chipping said trunk to pieces.
While I'm busy doing that I see my daughter sneaking up trying to scare me.
But I'm prepared.
The moment she comes close enough, I turn around, grab and tickle her.
That turns into playing a round of tag.
We spend the rest of this lovely morning together walking around the nearest town eating ice cream.
On our way home, we come across a deer on our path.
It's such a tame animal that we can even stroke it.
