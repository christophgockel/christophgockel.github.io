John just landed in Washington, but already got into trouble with some criminals.
He busted one of the two guys, and now he wants to talk to the captain of the police station of the airport.
He knocks at his door and enters the office of captain Lorenzo.
The moment he starts introducing himself the captain cuts him off and starts yelling at him.
He knew already who he was.
An asshole that just broke seven FAA and five district regulations.
All while running around his airport with a gun, shooting at people.
To the question what he would call that, John answers with &ldquo;_self-defense._&rdquo;
