I'm driving in my '74 Chevy Nova together with my colleague, and we're having a good conversation about his time in Europe.
Man&hellip; the stories he's telling are amazing.
I definitely need to go there myself one day.
I mean imagine, he's saying that you basically can buy beer at any shop at any given time.
The beer, the hash bars in Amsterdam&hellip; everything he's telling just sounds pretty awesome.
And while I'm enjoying listening to my friend Vincent's stories, he suddenly asks me if I knew what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris.
And I'm completely baffled.
Why wouldn't they call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese, too?
Then he explained that they have the metric system and wouldn't know what a Quarter Pounder is.
So I'm asking him what the heck do they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese then?
And he says &ldquo;a Royale with Cheese&rdquo;.
