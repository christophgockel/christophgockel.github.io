The group of agents finally found the suspects, handcuffed them and then led them away.
Now Sam and his girlfriend are being interrogated in one of the agent's van.
Until suddenly the convoy gets stopped.
The agents are not sure if they are getting attacked or what is happening.
Eventually all cars are being stopped and everyone has to get out.
Sam's friends are there to help them, and get them out of there.
They handcuff every agent and Simmons gets a special treatment.
Because of his hostile behaviour, he's handcuffed to a street lamp &ndash; only wearing his underwear.
