After Isaac told Hazel and Gus that Monica, his ex-girlfriend, never spoke to him again, they decided to seek some revenge.
They went to buy two dozen eggs and then headed to Monica's place.
Gus hands Isaac the first egg and he immediately throws it towards Monica's car, which is parked in front of her house.
His first throw goes in a somewhat different direction than initially anticipated, though.
Gus helps Isaac with his next throw, instructing him to aim more to his left.
The second egg hit the car on its rear bumper and they all scream in excitement!
