title: 88

I've been to prison once.
I've been married twice.
I had to live in shit-ass areas of Mexico for two and a half years for no reason.
I've had my eye socket punched in, a kidney taken out, and I got a bone chip in my ankle that's never gonna heal.
I've seen some pretty shitty situations in my life.
But nothing has ever sucked more ass than this.
If I'd known I was going to have to put up with screaming brats pissing on my lap for days out of the year, I would have killed myself a long time ago.
