title: 89

Ryan and Matt are on their little hike to the next shelter.
They had an accident and lost the rest of their crew and vehicle.
So they need to get to the next station in one piece.
Which isn't very certain given the situation they found themselves in.
To distract Ryan, Matt starts chit-chatting.
He asks where her home is.
After some pause she tells him Lake Zurich, Illinois.
Matt replies that it's there now about 8pm, and he goes on asking what the people from Lake Zurich do at 8 o'clock.
But Ryan doesn't know &ndash; or doesn't really want to think of that at the moment.
