There's this deep voice I'm hearing.
Feels awkward at the beginning.
But I'm starting to relax every muscle in my body.
I feel my eyelids getting heavy.
I slip deeper and deeper into a state of complete relaxation.
All my concerns are disappearing.
I do not hear that voice anymore.
But that's okay.
Wow.
I have this warm and fuzzy feeling in my body.
It feels like I'm born again.
Who are these people running across the room?
And why is this guy lying on the floor?
Well, actually I'm not that interested in it.
Life is good as it is right now.
I shouldn't worry too much about it.
