Colin jumps from job to job, not really knowing what to do or where to go in his life.
Today he's helping out as a waiter on a wedding, trying his best to be good at it, to be funny, chatty, friendly, all in all good at it.
Seems though, he's trying too hard: offering cheese on a plate as a _delicious delicacy_ or _taste explosion_ does not have the wanted effect.
Until he asks Nancy.
Nancy declines his offer, too, but he wants to be honest with her and starts chatting about that he understands why she disdains that edgy food &ndash; not yet knowing that Nancy is actually the cook who prepared it.
