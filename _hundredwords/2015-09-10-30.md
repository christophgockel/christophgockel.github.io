When Wallace and Chantry talk about their past, Wallace mentions he's a medical student drop out.
Then tells a story he remembers that when Elvis died, they found 40 pounds of undigested food in his intestines &ndash; which contained leftovers of what is called _Fool's Gold_.
For that you take a loaf of Italian white bread, coat it in butter and bake it.
Then you hollow out the inside and coat one side with an entire jar of peanut butter and the other side with an entire jar of jam.
After that you stuff it with a pound of crispy bacon.
The website he found the recipe on said it serves eight to ten people.
Or one Elvis.
