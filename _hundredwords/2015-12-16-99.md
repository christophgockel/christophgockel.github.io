Someone shoots his way into Jabba the Hutt's palace.
Jabba and the people inside it hear the screams and shoots from blaster pistols.
Then a bounty hunter walks in with a handcuffed Wookie.
He demands the bounty for that Wookie.
Jabba recognises the Wookie as Chewbacca and C-3PO translates Jabba's words for the bounty hunter.
He offers 25000 credits, which the bounty hunter rejects demanding twice as much.
Jabba is getting angry and asks why he should pay that amount.
That is the moment where the bounty hunter shows a thermal detonator in his hand.
Which impresses Jabba so much, that he's offering 35000 credits just because he appreciates the fearless and inventive nature of the bounty hunter.
