Lincoln wakes up from a bad dream.
For a few days already he has the same dream.
Every morning he wakes up in slight discomfort, but he can't really put the finger on it.
Something doesn't feel right but he's unable to express what exactly.
Then he gets up to get dressed.
While walking towards the bathroom, he comes across a display on his wall reminding him to pass by the tranquility centre for his wellness evaluation.
He then even gets screened already while using his toilet.
This device detects an excess of sodium in his body and advises control of his nutrition immediately.
