There's a big party in the penthouse of tall building going on.
A lady in a red dress goes to the balcony to get some fresh air.
He follows her slowly, which she doesn't notice at first.
As she hears his steps, though, she turns around.
Not too fast or surprised, but she wants to see who's following her.
He sees her shivering in the wind and they start talking.
After a while he offers her a cigarette, which she gladly accepts.
When she asks him if he's just as bored by the crowd at the party as she is, he denies.
He's there because of her.
