Am I&hellip; awake?

Am I&hellip; alive?

What is this?
Why does everything look like a bad television screen?
Who the hell are these people in front of me and why are they staring at me?
What did this guy just say? _&ldquo;Total body prosthesis&rdquo;_?
I can't speak.
Why can't I speak?
I can't even move.
But I want to know what is happening to me here.
And that robot arm over there?
Wait, what!?
Did I hear someone say _&ldquo;attach it to his shoulder&rdquo;_?
I feel so confused.
The last thing I remember is four guys from the Boddicker gang shooting me down like a sick animal.
