Some disagreement in a case Hubert was assigned with made his boss send him on holiday for a few weeks.
He picked China as his destination.
Somehow, though, after a few days he slipped into a case connected to the Yakuza.
Two lackeys pick him up and they bring him to a driving range.
Their boss is about to hit a ball.
Unfazed Hubert watches him prepare his swing.
Pertly he mentions that he will never hit the ball with a stance like that.
He should stick to a PlayStation, that way at least, he won't lose any balls.
