He's sitting in the Cafe 80's not really knowing what to order.
Cafe 80's is one of those nostalgia places, but not done very well.
Standing in the cafe like a deer in headlights, he's ordering a regular Pepsi after he gathered his wits again.
He's happy that he finally got rid of this little screen in front of him that was taking is order.
Then he takes a seat at the bar and looks around.
It looks so familiar yet so strange.
But then he sees the _Wild Gunman_ arcade game in the corner.
He's going to play it to show the kids standing next to it how good of a player is in that game.
