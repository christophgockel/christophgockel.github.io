Egon, Ray and Peter were called to the New York Public Library.
The library administrator reported some _strange_ things happening in the basement of the library.
Alice, an employee of the library, is witness to the phenomenon, and Peter and Ray are asking her a few questions about what she saw.
From the things she mentions, Ray gets more excited by every word she says.
After that, all three of them go to the basement for further investigations.
They come to an aisle with a huge stack of books.
Egon's PKE meter readings go right off the top of the scale.
_Burying the needle._
Ray remembers reading about a similar event: Symmetrical book stacking, just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947!
