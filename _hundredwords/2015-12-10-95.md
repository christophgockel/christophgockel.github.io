Obi-Wan visits Kamino to find out more about what is happening there.
There must be a reason why the planet's location was deleted from the archives.
When he arrives at Tipoca City he is welcomed, and everyone seemed to expect his visit already.
Lama Su, the prime minister of Kamino, is pleased to tell him that everything is on schedule.
Two hundred thousand units were ready, with another million well on the way.
Obi-Wan goes with it and is happy to hear the good news, not really knowing what all of that is about.
He asks if he could see and inspect the units by himself.
Which Lama Su is more than happy to do.
