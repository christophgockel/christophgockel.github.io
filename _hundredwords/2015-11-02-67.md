He had to watch his parents being taken from him by raiders who assaulted the village they lived in.
After they killed all women and men, they take the remaining children hostage to sell them into slavery.
Many children die during that time, the ones who survive, are exploited to perform child labour.
One son amongst them, though, swore to take revenge on the tribe who assaulted his village.
He will never forget the look of the battle standard they carried.
All the manual labour he's forced to do, he uses as training and grows stronger and stronger over the years.
Until he finally sets off to revenge his parents.
