Jim comes down with the elevator to walk his dog Hamlet, as he usually does after work.
Amanda is talking to the concierge because she's there for a flat viewing.
As the elevator doors open, Hamlet gets loose and runs towards Amanda.
Jim's trying to grab his leash, but the Hamlet is too quick.
Without seeing what hit her, Amanda gets knocked down to the floor.
The next thing she realises is that there's a huge dog on top of her, licking her face.
Jim runs to her immediately helping her up again.
He's apologising, but she sees the world in slow motion looking at him not really paying attention to his words.
