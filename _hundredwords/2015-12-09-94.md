The huge MTTs make their way across the forest.
Animals are fleeing from the huge vehicles.
Between the animals, Qui-Gon is running, too.
Until he approaches a lonely Gungan who stands in the middle of the forest, not knowing what is happening around him.
While running, Qui-Gon runs into him, and Jar Jar just grabs onto him because he doesn't know what else to do.
Even though Qui-Gon yelled at him to run away.
Eventually they drop into the mud so the MTTs can hover over them.
After its safe to get up again Jar Jar expresses his gratitude towards Qui-Gon.
He can only reply with a question: _&ldquo;Are you brainless? You almost got us killed!&rdquo;_
