The overseer announces that the eastern seaboard is coming online and everyone should get ready.
That's when Sulley and the rest of the scarers are walking into the room.
Every door assistant is already on their place next to the door and waiting for their colleague.
The scarers walk to their assigned doors and get into position.
They prepare themselves by stretching and putting on some accessories like teeth or more eyes and such.
Before they start, Sulley wants to wish Randall all the best and that the best monster may win.
To which Randall arrogantly answers with that he's planning to.
