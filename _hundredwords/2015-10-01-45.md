Emma feels stuck. Her energy drained, and she doesn't know if she can continue like that for much longer.
She doesn't like that job anyway, and it was meant to be as an intermediate solution.
But until she gains the energy to get out of that place, she explains, in the calmest way possible, the menu for the umpteenth time to the next customer:
A tortilla is either corn or wheat.
But a corn tortilla folded and filled is a taco, whereas a filled wheat tortilla is a burrito.
Deep fry a burrito, it's a chimichanga.
Toast a tortilla, it's a tostada.
Roll it, it's an enchilada.
