Lyn explains the lab he was working at a few years ago.
A secret lab, on the premises of the army base he &ndash; and several hundred other soldiers &ndash; were stationed, hidden inside an abandoned hospital.
Only a few people knew about the real function of that building; originally created as a secret laboratory to offer in-the-field surgical training: 
A goat gets shot, a student has to dress the wound successfully.
Another use of _the goat lab_ was to be the training ground for a special unit within the U.S. Army.
The New Earth Army &ndash; trained to use paranormal powers in their missions.
