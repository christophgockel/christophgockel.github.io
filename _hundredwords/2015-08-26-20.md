Danny and Nicholas are having beers at Danny's place.
They're sitting on the couch while Nicholas reminisces about his past.
Why his girlfriend broke up with him.
He realises that he was the main problem.
Not just him, but how he was obsessed with his job.
Or how he missed a few dinners, parties, a birthday or two, her dad's funeral&hellip;
But ultimately he just wants to be good at what he does.
Danny assures him he is good at what he does, he just needs to learn to switch off his melon from time to time.
Nicholas admits that the problem is, he doesn't know how.
