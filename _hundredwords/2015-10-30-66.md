John is walking along the street towards Hope, Washington when sheriff Teasel approaches him in his car.
He's welcoming him and immediately asking if he'd be visiting someone.
John denies that which makes the sheriff suspicious.
He then offers him a ride, because he wants to make sure he's heading the right direction.
John hesitates first, but realises if he'd deny his offer he'd be in worse trouble.
When John asks where he could find a place to eat, the sheriff suggests a place 30 miles north outside the town.
John's asking if there's a law against him eating in the town.
To which the sheriff just responds with: _&ldquo;Yeah, me.&rdquo;_
