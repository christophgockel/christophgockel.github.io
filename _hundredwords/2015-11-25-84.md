Late at night Selina walks into a bar accompanied by a random guy.
She signals him to take a seat while she walks further into the bar to a man sitting alone at a table.
He goes by the name of Stryver.
When she sits down, she passes a small envelope to him.
He verifies the content and pockets the envelope.
When he wants to get up, she asks him to slow down a bit and if he didn't bring anything for her, too?
He certainly did because the next thing she realises is that another guy is pointing a gun at her.
