Bill finished his cigarette outside the airport, before he goes to the check-in counter.
At the security check he overtakes one guy who's busy having a call instead of moving on putting his belongings in the containers for the x-ray scanner.
Now he's waiting at the gate and looks around.
Seems like the flight to London will be pretty crowded judging by the amount of people waiting at the gate.
When one of the flight assistants asks if he would like something to drink before takeoff, he orders a Gin and Tonic.
It's not his lucky day, though.
The drink she brings back is just a bottle of water.
