The cornerstones of the Channel 4 news team are represented by simple-minded Brick for the weather, sleazy Brian as a field reporter, picture-book masculine Champ as the sportscaster and last but not least flute enthusiast Ron as the anchorman.
They form a great and successful team that is loved throughout San Diego.
Until a new player entered the ring that is newscasting &ndash; the intelligent and cunning Veronica.
Ron and his team are neither happy nor willing to accept her in the group.
The imbroglio leads up to the point where Veronica changes Ron's teleprompter text to make him say something offensive.
Which gets Ron fired.
Smart beats lazy.
