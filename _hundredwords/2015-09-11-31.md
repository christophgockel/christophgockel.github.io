Leonard sits on his bed in a Motel and he holds paper notes and Polaroids in his hands.
He's aware of who and where he is.
He is not aware of what he's been up to, though.
When he looks in a mirror, he sees something on his skin.
Curious, he removes his shirt and it feels like he sees his own body for the first time.
He discovers a lot of tattoos on his body.
One thing they have in common is they're all letterings.
All over his body, but as an ordered list.
Slightly surprised he starts to read them.
