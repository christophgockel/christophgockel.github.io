Wray is coming to a BBQ restaurant.
JT, the owner, greets and shows him a place to sit at the bar.
They start chatting and JT mentions that he's throwing a party.
The restaurant has been open for 25 years and he's the second person for the evening coming to it.
The other guest, a woman, sits in a booth next to the front window.
Wray immediately recognises her.
He walks hover and greets her with _&ldquo;Hello Palomita.&rdquo;_
She responds that she's not going by that name anymore, because he used to call her like that back in the day.
