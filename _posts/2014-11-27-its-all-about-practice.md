title: It's all about Practice

Yesterday I had the chance to give a lightning talk at [Codebar](http://www.codebar.io).

The topic was &ldquo;Practice&rdquo;. How we, as developers, practice and what we can do to practice more. Spoiler: look for pet projects as a &ldquo;breakable toy&rdquo; and just build _something_.

But anyway, I'm always super nervous when I have to speak in front of an audience I don't really know. So I'm trying to get out of my comfort zone and practice that more (pun intended).

Codebar is a very good environment to do that. Everyone is there to learn, the students just as much as the coaches. So I think the idea of having a lightning talk before the coaching begins fits pretty well to Codebar (they started with the talks four or five weeks ago).

It was a good experience for me. Many students liked the talk, even though I stumbled a bit in between.

When I have an idea for a new talk, I definitely want to do it again.
