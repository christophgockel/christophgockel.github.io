Today we were working on the second story. It included some database changes. At least we thought changes to the DB structure were needed. But while implementing the feature, we realized that we can code around the need of a "real" n:m mapping.

Which was great because the current solution is way simpler than dealing with mapping tables and all that just to support an n:m mapping for "just" two values.
