title: Watching yourself code...
---

...is nearly as odd as hearing your own voice on tape.

Today I finished recording my Roman Numerals Kata in Ruby.

For a quite a time I couldn't get it done under 10 minutes. After watching the recordings of yourself code, you often come up with new ideas and different approaches.

It kinda feels like pairing with yourself &ndash; even though I prefer having a &ldquo;real&rdquo; pair.

A big time saver was a different approach on the order of the test cases. I switched from the implementation of the test cases for 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5 and so on to first implement all &ldquo;single letter&rdquo; numerals, and then adding the repetition handling like `2` converts to `II`.

A new input mode mapping for vim helped me as well. To insert a hash rocket (`=>`) I  can press just `<c-l>` now, and can reduce the finger movement of my right hand a bit. I came accross this mapping by chance when looking at [Gary Bernhardt's `.vimrc`](https://github.com/garybernhardt/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc#L141).

The result has been [uploaded to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDcfYI8atgY).
It's not a flawless recording, as I made some typos. But overall, I'm happy that I ended up with a 6:20 version now.
