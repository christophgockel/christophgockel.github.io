title: First Rails Story Finished
---

After spiking our solution yesterday, Makis and I reimplemented the story again test driven. It's way easier to TDD in Rails - even if you're like me and have little knowledge about the framework - after you first saw and tried what you have to do. Once you know how your solution should look like, it gets easier to start with a test.
