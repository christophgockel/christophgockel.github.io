title: Unicorns for Speclj
---

Since I started with Clojure this week, there is a whole new environment to learn. New language, new build tool, new testing framework(s), new everything...

To get myself more familiar with Clojure and [Speclj](http://speclj.com) I decided to invest my Waza Friday afternoon with creating a Speclj plugin for [unicornleap](https://github.com/KevinLiddle/unicornleap).

The final result is available on [GitHub (source)](https://github.com/christophgockel/speclj-unicornleap) and published on [Clojars](https://clojars.org/speclj-unicornleap).

It was interesting and frustrating at times. Mostly because I know so little about Clojure yet that the main blocks I had weren't like _&ldquo;how do I do that&hellip;?&rdquo;_ but more like _&ldquo;how do I do that in Clojure&hellip;?&rdquo;_.

I learned quite a lot while implementing it. Granted, the code needed to write the plugin itself is really small, but I know more now about some Speclj internals and how dependency management is done with Leiningen.

To be fair, it isn't the most useful plugin, but as a learning exercise it really was useful for me. And that's what counts, isn't it?
