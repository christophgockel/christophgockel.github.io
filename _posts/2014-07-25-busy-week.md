This week was pretty packed.

Finishing the 4x4 board story, getting into Qt and create a GUI for my Tic Tac Toe game, and fixing some minor issues in the core Tic Tac Toe game logic.

_I really need to work either on my estimates or on my time scheduling. Or maybe both…_

Then today we had a kick off meeting for a new internal project we, the London apprentices amongst others, will spent some time on during the upcoming weeks. I’m looking forward to it, since it'll be my first contact with Rails.
