title: First Week

This was my first week as an apprentice at 8th Light.
On monday we planned my tasks for this week. And on every day I worked on them, read articles and documentation about Ruby/Rspec. Mostly focussing on the Tic Tac Toe implementation in Ruby.

Being only halfway through the implementation of the computer opponent in the Tic Tac Toe game, I honestly have to admit that I underestimated the time it takes to rewrite the game in Ruby a lot. I didn’t expected that it would take this long.

So for the planning of the next tasks I should probably estimate more conservatively. At least until I'm more comfortable with the language.

Also on the list for this week is the recording of the execution of the Roman Numerals Kata. I have practiced it throughout the week, but I’m not yet at the <5 minutes goal. Currently at around 10 minutes (+/-) with a downward tendency. As I do not want to make too much mistakes or typos when recording, I'm a bit more agitated than when I'm &ldquo;just writing code&rdquo;. I often see myself thinking about what exactly to type/press, than just write code to get it done.

I will record the final execution of the kata on the weekend and publish the results here, of course.
