title: First Day in the Office

Today was my official commencement date at the 8th Light office in London.

As I already have met Jim and the other apprentices the days before, it didn’t really felt like being the &ldquo;new guy&rdquo; in a new environment.

So I could directly go on with my Ruby Tic Tac Toe implementation. The more I dive into Ruby the more I realise what I still need to learn about the language. I haven’t yet internalised all the mapping, reducing, injecting, collecting and more [`Enumerable`](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Enumerable.html) stuff that is the Ruby-way of doing things. But I’ll work on that!

As [Mike](http://www.8thlight.com/team/mike-ebert) is in town this week, we’re happy he held a small code retreat with us today. It was a good experience pairing with the other apprentices, seeing how everyone in the new team approaches a given problem. Especially when it comes to such &ldquo;simple&rdquo; problems as the [Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). The constraints were also fun, as there were new constraints I wasn’t challenged with yet in a code retreat. Like &ldquo;no primitives across method boundaries&rdquo; for example. The constraint &ldquo;no speaking&rdquo; is always fun too, and being a relatively new team it can be really challenging!

In the evening everybody in the office went out together to celebrate [Daniel’s](http://www.8thlight.com/apprentices/daniel-irvine) birthday. Having a night out really can break the ice and helps getting to know each other better.
